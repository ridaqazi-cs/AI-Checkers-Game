# AI Checkers Game with Reinforcement Learning

This is a fully functional Checkers game implemented in **Python** using **Pygame**. It includes an **AI opponent powered by Q-learning**, a form of reinforcement learning. The AI can improve its gameplay via training and supports multiple difficulty levels, game modes, and a live stats dashboard.

## Game Features

- ✅ Human vs AI, Human vs Human, and AI vs AI modes  
- ✅ Multiple difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard  
- ✅ Training for reinforcement learning  
- ✅ Live statistics dashboard: win/loss/tie count and average moves  
- ✅ Turn indicators and endgame messages  
- ✅ Graphical menu for mode and difficulty selection

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure you have `q_black.pkl` and `q_red.pkl` in the same folder.
3. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Play

### Main Menu
When the game launches:

- Press:
  - `1` → Human vs AI
  - `2` → Human vs Human
  - `3` → AI vs AI
  - `4` → Training Mode
- Then press:
  - `e` → Easy AI
  - `m` → Medium AI
  - `h` → Hard AI

The game begins once both are selected.

### Human Player Controls

- Click a piece of your color to select it.
- Valid destinations will be **highlighted in green**.
- Click a destination to move.
- Captures are forced if available.
- Multi-jumps are automatically handled.

### AI Behavior

- Uses **Q-learning** to learn optimal moves.
- Difficulty affects randomness:
  - **Easy**: very random
  - **Medium**: mostly smart
  - **Hard**: nearly optimal

## How Q-Learning Works

- The board is encoded as a string state.
- Actions like `2,3->3,4` represent piece moves.
- Rewards:
  - +10 for captures
  - +100 for winning
  - -100 for losing
- Values are updated with the **Bellman equation**.

- Add sound effects  
- Visual animations  
- Online multiplayer  
- Upgrade to Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
